# Discord Bot - Squirrel
This is a git for Discord bot made using **"Luckshya's Sleepy Discord Module for VC:MP(Squirrel)"**.

I have provided the plugins of 64-bit devices above, the Linux plugin is the one containing `.so` at the end and the Windows plugin is the one containing `.dll` at the end.

## Usage
Please refer to the wiki for usage details.

The script is easy to use, has many features you can use, and runs on the latest Squirrel module by Luckshya.

Message me on Discord if anything doesn't work or if you're confused about something.
