# Discord Bot - Squirrel
This is a git for Discord bot made using **"Luckshya's Sleepy Discord for Squirrel module"**. 

I'll provide the link for the same, and I'll provide the necessary things in the repo itself, for example, the plugin needed, executables for running the bot etc. 

Keep in mind that, you will have to edit the script according to your convenience and remember adding the bot token and reading the comments properly.

> **Bonus** : If you are a VC:MP Server Developer, you just need to dofile the Discord bot script and load the plugin through server.cfg, your work is done.
